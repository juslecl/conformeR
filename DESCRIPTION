Description: Multi-condition single-cell RNA sequencing reveals how gene expression varies across conditions within specific cell populations. Most current methods model these changes by fitting gene-wise generalized linear models to read counts, and then detect differential expression using statistical tests such as the likelihood-ratio test or the quasi-likelihood F-test \citep{edgeR}. Each gene $\times$ cell pair occurs only once in the dataset and is observed under a single condition. Predicting counterfactual expression levels---e.g., estimating how a cell would express genes under treatment even if observed under control---increases sample size by imputing expression values for all conditions. This might reduce false discovery rates and improve detection power, both key to efficient statistical testing.The method LEMUR \citep{lemur} addresses this imputation task using a type of PCA that learns for each cell a low-rank structure per condition. The flexibility of the model makes uncertainty more challenging to quantify, an open problem as stated by the authors of LEMUR. Our conformeR is a wrapper around LEMUR R-package that adds uncertainty quantification without altering the underlying model. conformeR constructs prediction intervals for LEMUR-imputed values with finite-sample coverage guarantees using conformal prediction \citep{cpvovk}, which relies on the assumption that cells from the same biological replicate and cell type are exchangeable. By inverting conformal prediction intervals, conformeR outputs for each gene $\times$ cell pair a p-value that encodes the difference between the observed and predicted expression levels. We then adjust these p-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure \citep{bh_correction}, leveraging the fact that conformal p-values satisfy the positive regression dependence on a subset condition \citep{pval_prds}. Finally, conformeR aggregates over cells from the same replicate and cell type to yield a single p-value per gene.
